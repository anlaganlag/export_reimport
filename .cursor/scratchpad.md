# Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation
Converting the process_shipping_list.py script into a Streamlit web application to allow users to upload input and policy files to generate export invoices. This will make the process more user-friendly and accessible.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. File handling - Need to manage file uploads and downloads securely
2. User interface - Must be intuitive and bilingual (English/Chinese)

4. Error handling - Clear feedback for users when issues occur
5. Environment setup - Need cross-platform setup scripts for easy deployment

## High-level Task Breakdown
1. ✅ Setup basic Streamlit app structure
   - Success criteria: App runs and shows basic UI
2. ✅ Create file upload interface
   - Success criteria: Users can upload files and see confirmation
3. ✅ Adapt processing functions
   - Success criteria: Core functionality works with uploaded files
4. ✅ Add download interface
   - Success criteria: Generated files can be downloaded
5. ✅ Enhance UI/UX
   - Success criteria: Interface is user-friendly and bilingual
6. ✅ Create setup scripts and documentation
