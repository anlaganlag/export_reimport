# Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation
- Convert process_shipping_list.py to a Streamlit web application
- Allow users to upload input files and policy files
- Generate export invoices based on the uploaded files
- Follow the workflow described in WORKFLOW-CN.md

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. File Handling:
   - Need to handle file uploads through Streamlit interface
   - Need to manage temporary storage of uploaded files
   - Need to handle different file formats (xlsx)

2. User Interface Requirements:
   - File upload interface for input files and policy files
   - Progress indicators for processing steps
   - Error messages and validation feedback
   - Download buttons for generated files
   - Clear status messages in both English and Chinese

3. Processing Logic:
   - Maintain existing processing logic from process_shipping_list.py
   - Add input validation and error handling
   - Ensure proper file paths handling in Streamlit environment

## High-level Task Breakdown
1. Setup Basic Streamlit App [Success Criteria: App runs and shows basic UI]
   - Create new app.py file
   - Setup basic Streamlit structure
   - Add page title and description

2. Create File Upload Interface [Success Criteria: Files can be uploaded and saved]
   - Add file uploaders for input files
   - Add file type validation
   - Implement temporary file storage
   - Show upload status and file info

3. Adapt Processing Functions [Success Criteria: Core functionality works in Streamlit]
   - Import and modify process_shipping_list.py functions
   - Adapt file path handling for Streamlit
   - Add progress indicators
   - Implement error handling

4. Add Download Interface [Success Criteria: Generated files can be downloaded]
   - Create download buttons for output files
   - Implement file format conversion if needed
   - Add success messages
   - Handle download errors

5. Add UI Enhancements [Success Criteria: UI is user-friendly and informative]
   - Add processing status indicators
   - Add validation messages
   - Add help text and instructions
   - Style the interface

## Project Status Board
- [x] Task 1: Setup Basic Streamlit App
  - ✅ Created app.py with basic structure
  - ✅ Added page title and description
  - ✅ Created requirements.txt
- [x] Task 2: Create File Upload Interface
  - ✅ Added file uploaders for input files
  - ✅ Added file type validation
  - ✅ Implemented temporary file storage
  - ✅ Added upload status messages
- [ ] Task 3: Adapt Processing Functions
- [ ] Task 4: Add Download Interface
- [ ] Task 5: Add UI Enhancements

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
- Tasks 1 and 2 completed successfully
- Basic Streamlit app is working with file upload functionality
- Need to test the processing function integration
- Ready to proceed with Task 3

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
I've completed the basic Streamlit app setup and file upload interface. The app now:
1. Has a bilingual interface (English/Chinese)
2. Supports Excel file uploads for both packing list and policy files
3. Creates a temporary directory for file processing
4. Has basic error handling and user feedback

Would you like me to:
1. Proceed with Task 3 (adapting the processing functions)?
2. Add any additional features to the current implementation?
3. Make any changes to the current interface?

## Lessons
- Keep user feedback visible and clear
- Maintain existing processing logic while adapting for web interface
- Provide both English and Chinese interface elements
- Handle file operations carefully in web environment
- Use temporary directories for file processing to avoid conflicts
