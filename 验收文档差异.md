Okay, I will analyze the provided documents and code to identify the differences and check the coverage of the validation program.

First, I need to examine the code within the `validators` directory. I'll read the contents of `input_validator.py`, `process_validator.py`, and `utils.py`.



Read file: validation_program/validators/utils.py

Read file: validation_program/validators/input_validator.py

Read file: validation_program/validators/process_validator.py
Based on the initial scan of the documents and validator code, here's a preliminary comparison:

**1. `验收文档（进出口文件生成）V1.2.md` vs. `WORKFLOW-CN.md`:**

*   **Scope:** `验收文档` is a comprehensive requirements specification covering input validation, processing rules, output formats, and specific checks for each generated document. `WORKFLOW-CN.md` primarily details the *data processing flow*, focusing on calculations (FOB, CIF), trade type handling, and the generation sequence, especially regarding the intermediate CIF invoice.
*   **Detail Level:**
    *   `验收文档` provides more specific validation criteria (e.g., exact header text, decimal places for汇率, specific field mappings for each output document, amount in words requirement, file dialog behavior, error handling specifics).
    *   `WORKFLOW-CN.md` provides more detail on the *calculation logic* (how FOB, Insurance, Freight, CIF are derived) and the implications of trade types (General vs. 买单) on output generation (e.g., only General trade produces export files).
*   **Discrepancies/Gaps in Workflow Doc:**
    *   Doesn't explicitly mention the requirement for a file selection dialog with persistent location (验收文档 II.1).
    *   Doesn't explicitly detail the error handling mechanism (验收文档 II.3).
    *   Doesn't explicitly mention the "Amount in Words" requirement (验收文档 II.7).
    *   Doesn't explicitly mention the template folder requirement (验收文档 II.2) or company-specific template usage (验收文档 II.4, II.5) although implied by the process.
    *   The workflow focuses heavily on the intermediate `CIF原始发票`, which isn't a final required output in the `验收文档` but is a crucial step in the described process.
    *   Workflow mentions splitting import invoices by *project* then factory, while the `验收文档` (V.1) only mentions splitting by *Plant Location* (工厂地点). This might be a discrepancy or an implementation detail not fully captured in the requirements.
*   **Consistency:** Both documents seem consistent regarding:
    *   Merging logic (based on Part Number/Material Code and Price).
    *   Precision requirements for Export CI (Unit Price 6 decimals, Total Amount 2 decimals).
    *   File naming conventions (though specifics might differ slightly).
    *   Basic output file structure (Export CI+PL, Import PL+CI per factory, separate Customs Declaration).

**2. `验收文档（进出口文件生成）V1.2.md` vs. `validators` Code Coverage:**

*   **`input_validator.py` Coverage:**
    *   **Seems Covered:**
        *   I.(一).1: Packing list header text ("采购装箱单") and presence of a number (`validate_packing_list_header`).
        *   I.(一).2: Packing list header field names (checks for presence of required Chinese and English fields, attempts to handle different header structures) (`validate_packing_list_field_headers`). The list of required fields seems comprehensive based on the doc.
        *   I.(一).3: Check if Net Weight < Gross Weight (`validate_weights` - partially visible).
        *   I.(二).1: Policy file number matches packing list number (`validate_policy_file_id`).
        *   I.(二).2: Exchange rate decimal places (`validate_exchange_rate_decimal` - partially visible).
        *   I.(二).3: Presence of company/bank info in policy file (`validate_company_bank_info` - partially visible).
    *   **Likely Missing/Partially Covered in `input_validator.py`:**
        *   I.(一).1: Specifically checking "采购装箱单编号" text, not just any number format. The current check (`validate_packing_list_header`) looks for specific text *and* a number pattern, which is close.
        *   II.1: File selection dialog behavior (This is a runtime UI requirement, not typically validated by file content validators).
        *   II.3: Runtime error handling presentation (Also a runtime behavior).
        *   II.7: Amount in Words validation (Requires checking specific cell content in output files, likely belongs in `process_validator.py`).
        *   II.12: Merging rule validation (This validates the *output* based on input, likely belongs in `process_validator.py`).
        *   III-VIII: All output file validation requirements (These belong in `process_validator.py`).

*   **`process_validator.py` Coverage (Based on visible code/outline):**
    *   **Seems Covered/Attempted:**
        *   Workflow: Trade type identification (`validate_trade_type_identification`).
        *   Workflow: Trade type splitting logic (`validate_trade_type_split`).
        *   Workflow: FOB, Insurance, Freight, CIF calculation validation (`validate_fob_price_calculation`, `validate_insurance_calculation`, `validate_freight_calculation`, `validate_cif_price_calculation`). These seem to primarily check if the necessary input columns/values exist, rather than performing the full calculation and comparison, but it's a start.
        *   II.12 / Workflow: Merging logic validation (`validate_merge_logic`). Checks if export invoice reflects merging from CIF invoice.
        *   II.11 / Workflow: Precision for Export CI (Implicitly checked if `validate_merge_logic` compares values, configuration for precision exists).
        *   V.1 / Workflow: Import invoice splitting by factory (The `validate_all` function seems to take an `import_invoice_dir`, implying checks related to multiple import files).
        *   IV.2 / VI.2: Matching totals between input and output PLs (`validate_import_totals_match` exists, presumably checks import PL totals against original PL. A similar check might exist for export PL implicitly or explicitly).
    *   **Likely Missing/Partially Covered in `process_validator.py`:**
        *   II.2: Template folder usage (Hard to validate programmatically unless output structure is checked against templates).
        *   II.4, II.5: Company-specific template application (Hard to validate without knowing template content).
        *   II.6: Date format check (`yyyy/mm/dd`).
        *   II.7: Amount in Words check.
        *   II.8: Export Customs Declaration as separate file check.
        *   II.9: Export CI+PL structure (PL sheet name, CI sheet name = invoice number).
        *   II.10: Import PL+CI structure (PL first sheet, CI sheet name = invoice number).
        *   III.1: Export CI output check (Existence and basic structure).
        *   III.2: Export CI field mapping validation.
        *   III.3: Export CI Quantity = Total Quantity check.
        *   III.4: Export CI Unit Price (CIF USD) > Unit Price (Excl. Tax CNY) check.
        *   III.5: Export CI Total Amount (CIF USD) > (FOB + Freight + Insurance) check.
        *   IV.1: Export PL field mapping validation.
        *   V.2: Number of import files matches number of factories check.
        *   V.3: Import file naming uniqueness and factory correspondence check.
        *   V.4: Plant Location field used for splitting check (Implicitly validated if V.1-V.3 pass).
        *   VI.1: Import PL field mapping validation.
        *   VII.1: Customs Declaration content generation check.
        *   VIII.1: Output format matches template check (Difficult).
        *   VIII.2: Specific output file naming rule checks for all three output types.

**Summary:**

1.  **Document Discrepancy:** The main potential discrepancy is how import invoices are split (`验收文档`: by Plant Location; `WORKFLOW-CN.md`: by Project then Plant Location). The `验收文档` also details several UI/runtime requirements (file dialog, error messages, amount in words) not covered in the `WORKFLOW-CN.md`.
2.  **Validator Coverage:**
    *   `input_validator.py` seems to cover most requirements for validating the *input* files (`验收文档` Section I) reasonably well, although some checks might need refinement (e.g., specific "采购装箱单编号" text).
    *   `process_validator.py` attempts to validate parts of the processing logic described in `WORKFLOW-CN.md` (like calculations and merging) and some output aspects (like totals matching). However, it appears to be **missing validation for many specific output requirements** detailed in `验收文档` Sections II-VIII, particularly concerning:
        *   Field mapping in output files.
        *   Specific comparisons between input and output values (e.g., Export CI price checks).
        *   Structural requirements of the output Excel files (sheet names, sheet order).
        *   File naming conventions.
        *   Generation of the Customs Declaration content.
        *   The "Amount in Words" requirement.
        *   Date formatting.

The validation program needs significant expansion to cover all requirements specified in `验收文档（进出口文件生成）V1.2.md`, especially regarding the structure, content, and specific value checks of the generated output files.
